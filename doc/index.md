The Cosmos Generic Enabler enables an easier BigData analysis over context
integrated with some of the most popular BigData platforms.

Cosmos is a FIWARE Generic Enabler. Therefore, it can be integrated as part of any platform “Powered by FIWARE”. FIWARE is a curated framework of open source platform components which can be assembled together with other third-party platform components to accelerate the development of Smart Solutions.

You can find more info at the [FIWARE developers](https://developers.fiware.org/) website and the [FIWARE](https://fiware.org/) website.

The complete list of FIWARE GEs and Incubated FIWARE GEs can be found at the [FIWARE Catalogue](https://catalogue.fiware.org/)

## What is Cosmos?

The Cosmos BigData Analysis GE is a set of tools that help achieving the tasks
of Streaming and Batch processing over context data. These tools are:

* Orion-Flink Connector (Source and Sink)
* Apache Flink Processing Engine
* Apache Spark Processing Engine (work in progress)
* Streaming processing examples using Orion Context Broker

## Why use Cosmos?

As the state of the real world changes, the entities representing your
IoT devices are constantly changing. Big data analysis allows for the
study of datasets coming from your context data which are too large
for traditional data-processing software. You can apply predictive
analysis or user behaviour analytics to extract meaningful conclusions
as to the state of your smart solution and bring value to your
solution.
